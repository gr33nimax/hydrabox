/**
 * The tunnel, as Android runs it, in its own process (`:core`).
 *
 * Its lifetime is the contract D01 was about, and it has exactly two reasons to exist: a tunnel
 * that is wanted, and a client that is bound. `startForegroundService` gives it the first,
 * `stopSelfResult` takes it away once the runtime releases the core; a binding gives it the
 * second, and the client that opened the screens is the one that must let go — which is why the
 * interface activity binds in `onStart` without `BIND_AUTO_CREATE` and unbinds in `onStop`. A
 * bound client keeps a service alive whatever `stopSelf` says, so a binding held from `onCreate`
 * for the life of the activity kept this whole process resident after a disconnect, with the
 * database open, the network monitor registered and about 210 MB of PSS to show for it.
 *
 * There is no `restart()` and no warm state that outlives the screens: a stop releases the core
 * and lets the platform reclaim this process, which is what the person asked for when they
 * pressed disconnect.

     * with logging disabled — works only on a core that reports `runtime_log_level`; on an
     * older one the call is accepted and changes nothing, so a reconnect is asked for
     * instead of reporting a level that is not in effect.
