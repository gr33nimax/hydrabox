/**
 * One offline measurement pass: the cheap workerless edge questions first, the sequential
 * standalone HTTP sessions after, each published as its own answer.
 *
 * The rules live here, away from the service, so they are testable without a core, the
 * platform or a device. The pass ends the moment its epoch moves or its sweep is
 * cancelled — a stop, a revoke, or a handover — and nothing it measured is published
 * unless the network it was measured on is still the network the device is on: results
 * collected across a handover are a comparison that only holds within one network.
