     * stopped using the platform's. `https://` is a TLS session with the resolver itself, and

     * A resolver named by hostname has to have that name resolved by something else, and the
     * platform is the only thing that can do it before the tunnel exists. A resolver named by
     * address — including `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query` — needs nothing.
     *
     * Everything here is checked rather than assumed. The parse used to cut the authority at the

     * scheme it did not know to `udp`, so a `quic://` resolver silently became a plaintext one on
     * port 53; and it dropped the query of a DoH address, which for a provider that keys on it is
