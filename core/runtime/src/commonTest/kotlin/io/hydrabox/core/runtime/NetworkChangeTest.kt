/**
 * What a network change is allowed to do, per state. The table is HydraBox 1.x's
 * (`CoreRuntimeService.reduce` for `NetworkChanged`, plus `applyNetworkChangeAction`), and it
 * is a table rather than a single rule for a reason: a running tunnel has lanes to move, a
 * starting one only needs to know where to dial, and a stopping one has nothing to move at all.
 *
 * The order this produces on the platform side matters more than the states. A lane replaced
 * before the core has been told the new generation cannot be superseded in sequence, so the
 * transport tears every lane down and rebuilds it — which, for a VK parasite session, means
 * rejoining the conversation and eventually being refused.
